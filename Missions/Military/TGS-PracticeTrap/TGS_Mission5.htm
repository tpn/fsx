<p class="BRFbodycopy">Your objective in this mission is a simple one: land on an aircraft carrier.

<p class="BRFbodycopy">With over 5,000 flight hours and more than 1,200 carrier landings in the F-14 Tomcat, Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is the most experienced Tomcat pilot in the world. Only a few select Naval Aviators qualify as a Senior Air Wing Landing Signal Officer (LSO), as such Snort spent many years working on board aircraft carriers quailing new pilots. Snort helped create this mission.</p>

<p class="BRFbodycopy">Make no mistake: flying this mission isn’t easy. But neither is landing on a real aircraft carrier. While the consequences for making an error are admittedly not as high in the sim, we believe that anyone who takes the time to master this mission will acquire a good taste of what real naval aviators experience every time they make an arrested landing in a real Hornet.

          <p class="SubHead2">Introduction</p>
             <p class="BRFbodycopy">The aircraft carrier is moving eastward at 25 knots. The Base Recovery Course, or “BRC” (the magnetic heading of the ship during flight operations) is 090 degrees. 
<br>
<br>
The mission begins in the air, 1.7 nautical miles (NM) aft of the carrier. The gear, flaps, and hook are all extended.

          <p class="SubHead2">Turn to final</p>
<ol>
<li>Look for the ball on the left side of the carrier deck.
<li>Rolling into “the groove” (final approach), increase descent rate to 600-750 FPM.
<li>Cross the carrier's wake and turn 10 more degrees to line up with angled deck (080 degrees).
<li>Intercept the glide slope at 3/4 mile.
<li>Line up with the centerline/drop line at the aft end of the carrier.
</ol>
</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Groove length:
<ul>
<li>Perfect: 17 seconds
<li>>21 seconds: “Long in the groove”
<li><12 seconds: “Not enough straightaway”
</ul>
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">Final Approach</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">
<ol>
<li>Stay on speed (135 knots) using the AOA indicator (circle lit up).
<li>Stay on glidepath (700 FPM). Adjust power to keep the meatball between the green lights.
<ul><li>If high, decrease power (maintain AOA with stick).
<li>If low, increase power (maintain AOA with stick).
</ul>
<li>Correct speed with the stick, altitude with the throttle.
</ol>
</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Remember that the angled deck is offset 10 degrees to the left (port) from the carrier’s magnetic heading (BRC). Thus, the boat is always moving slightly from left to right.
<br>
<br>
The ideal approach is a constant 3-degree glideslope down the groove to touchdown, with a constant 700 FPM descent. You’ll see a centered meatball, the airspeed will stay constant at 135.
<br>
<br>
A more typical approach will have you making small corrections all the way down the groove.
<br>
<br>
Watch the meatball, and do not stare at the deck. Your scan should be: “Meatball, line-up, angle of attack. Meatball, line-up, angle of attack.” Make SMALL corrections as necessary.
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">Touchdown
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Remember, the hook catches the wire, not you&mdash;it will look like you’re high as you approach the carrier deck. In the real-world, pilots apply full power just before touchdown in case they need to go around. In Flight Simulator, the engine can over-power the cable, so either land with Idle power, or increase to full and then reduce it immediately if you trap.
<br>
<br>
Do not flare! Just watch the meatball and fly the glideslope until you hit the deck. The ideal is to catch the 3 wire. Just put the hook between the 2 wire and the 3 wire. (Simple, right?)
