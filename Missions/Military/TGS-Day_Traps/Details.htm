          <p class="SubHead2">Introduction</p>
          <p class="BRFbodycopy">The aircraft carrier is moving eastward at 25 knots. The Base Recovery Course, or “BRC” (the magnetic heading of the ship during flight operations) is 090 degrees. The aircraft launches on this heading, and the downwind leg is flown on the reciprocal heading (270 degrees).
Unlike a normal VFR traffic pattern at an airport, a carrier pattern isn’t a rectangle: it’s an oval. You make a 180-degree turn from Upwind to Downwind and from Downwind to Final. There are no “Crosswind” or “Base” legs.
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">Launch</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">
<ol><li>Taxi to Catapult 2 (the left catapult at the bow of the carrier).
<li>Taxi so that the nosewheel stops in the red and white box.
<li>Move the Launch Bar switch to <strong>Extend</strong> (press <strong>SHIFT+U</strong>). Note that the green “L Bar” advisory light in the cockpit illuminates, and observe in Spot view that the launch bar has lowered.
<li>Attach the holdback bar (press <strong>SHIFT+I</strong>). Observe in Spot view that the jet blast deflector door raises.
<li>Check that the flaps are set to <strong>Full</strong> (press <strong>F8</strong>)
<li>Release the brakes (press <strong>PERIOD</strong>).
<li>Move the throttle lever all the way forward to Full afterburner (move joystick throttle or press <strong>F4</strong>).
<li>Salute the catapult officer (press <strong>SHIFT+SPACE</strong>).
<li>The catapult will launch the aircraft, and the aircraft will rotate nose up to the trimmed angle of attack without stick input.
</ol>
</p>

          <p class="SubHead2">Climb</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">
<ol>
<li>Reduce power and maintain 150 knots while climbing to 600 feet (keep the gear and flaps down).
<li>Start a left turn to Downwind within 2 nautical miles (NM) of the carrier (look at the Mission Compass for distance).
<li>Lower the arresting hook (press <strong>SHIFT+Q</strong>).
</ol>
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">Downwind</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">
<ol>
<li>Roll out on Downwind on a heading of 270 degrees, 1.1-1.3 NM from the carrier (look at the Mission Compass for distance).
<li>Maintain 600 feet, and slow to 135 knots (85-88% RPM).
<li>Adjust pitch to display the orange circle in the Angle of Attack indicator to the left of the HUD. Adjust power to maintain altitude.
<ul>
<li>If you see the green downward-pointing chevron, you're slow: pitch down slightly to increase airspeed.
<li>If you see the red upward-pointing chevron, you're fast: pitch up slightly to decrease airspeed.
</ul>
<li>Complete the Landing checklist (Wheels Down, Flaps Down, Hook Down).
<li>Abeam the carrier you’ll hear the LSO confirm your position (“Roger, abeam”).
</ol>
</p>

          <p class="SubHead2">Turn to final</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">
Abeam the aft end of the carrier:
<ol>
<li>Fly on instruments.
<li>Start a left turn, with 25-30 degrees of bank.
<li>Begin a very gradual descent.
<li>Aim for 500 feet at “the 90” (heading 180 degrees).
<li>At “the 90,” transition to fly looking out the window at the carrier.
<li>Look for the ball on the left side of the carrier deck.
<li>Rolling into “the groove” (final approach), increase descent rate to 600-750 FPM.
<li>Cross the carrier's wake and turn 10 more degrees to line up with angled deck (080 degrees).
<li>Intercept the glide slope at 3/4 mile.
<li>Line up with the centerline/drop line at the aft end of the carrier.
</ol>
</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Groove length:
<ul>
<li>Perfect: 17 seconds
<li>>21 seconds: “Long in the groove”
<li><12 seconds: “Not enough straightaway”
</ul>
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">Final Approach</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">
<ol>
<li>Stay on speed (135 knots) using the AOA indicator (circle lit up).
<li>Stay on glidepath (700 FPM). Adjust power to keep the meatball between the green lights.
<ul><li>If high, decrease power (maintain AOA with stick).
<li>If low, increase power (maintain AOA with stick).
</ul>
<li>Correct speed with the stick, altitude with the throttle.
</ol>
</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Remember that the angled deck is offset 10 degrees to the left (port) from the carrier’s magnetic heading (BRC). Thus, the boat is always moving slightly from left to right.
<br>
<br>
The ideal approach is a constant 3-degree glideslope down the groove to touchdown, with a constant 700 FPM descent. You’ll see a centered meatball, the airspeed will stay constant at 135, and you’ll hear no calls from the LSO.
<br>
<br>
A more typical approach will have you making small corrections all the way down the groove, with the LSO issuing guidance to you.
<br>
<br>
Watch the meatball, and do not stare at the deck. Your scan should be: “Meatball, line-up, angle of attack. Meatball, line-up, angle of attack.” Make SMALL corrections as necessary.
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">Touchdown
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Remember, the hook catches the wire, not you&mdash;it will look like you’re high as you approach the carrier deck. In the real-world, pilots apply full power just before touchdown in case they need to go around. In Flight Simulator, the engine can over-power the cable, so either land with Idle power, or increase to full and then reduce it immediately if you trap.
<br>
<br>
Do not flare! Just watch the meatball and fly the glideslope until you hit the deck. The ideal is to catch the 3 wire. Just put the hook between the 2 wire and the 3 wire. (Simple, right?)

          <p class="SubHead2">Waveoff/Bolter
<p class="BRFbodycopy">If the LSO waves you off (“Wave off!”) or if you bolter (miss the wires), you need to climb back into the pattern for another attempt. Here’s how:
<ol>
<li>Immediately apply Full afterburner power and pitch up slightly to stop the descent.
<li>Maintain 150 knots and climb to 600 feet (keep the gear and flaps down).
<li>Turn right 10 degrees to a heading of 090 to parallel the ship's heading.
<li>Start a left turn to Downwind within 2 NM of the carrier (look at the Mission Compass for distance).
</ol>
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">LSO Calls/De-brief
<p class="BRFbodycopy">As you fly down “the groove” toward the deck of the carrier, the LSO (Dale “Snort” Snodgrass in this mission) will offer you guidance if you need it. The LSO calls are fairly self-explanatory. For example, if you’re high he might say, “You’re high.” “Power!” means to add power since you’re low. “Come right for lineup” means that you’re left of the centerline, and need to come to the right to line up with the centerline.
If you hear the LSO say the word “Waveoff!,” you must abort the approach and go around. (See the section above for details.)
<br>
<br>
Each time you trap, the LSO will give you a de-brief of your pass. The de-brief includes comments for each of the five phases of the approach:
<ul>
<li>“At the Start” (3/4 to 1/2 mile from the carrier)
<li>"In the Middle” (3/4 to 1/2 mile from the carrier)
<li>“In Close” (1/4 mile from the carrier)
<li>“At the Ramp” (crossing the aft end of the carrier)
<li>“In the Wires” (in the wires)
</ul>
</p>
          <p class="SubHead2">After Landing
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Each time you trap successfully, taxi back to Catapult 2 for another launch. If you roll too far forward after trapping, Catapult 2 might be slightly behind your right wing. You’ll have to taxi past it then turn around.
Remember: the mission ends once you've made six passes (landing attempts). Traps, bolters, and waveoffs all count as passes!
</p>
<p class="BRFbodycopy"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>
<br>
Due to a limitation in the aircraft carrier simulation within Microsoft FSX Acceleration, the simulation may detect more than one wire being caught during a single trap. If this happens the mission will end prematurely. In order to compensate for this possibility, the TopgunSim scoring system will take the average of the actual passes taken in that mission and assign that averaged score to the remaining passes not taken. If this happens, your score will still count for purposes of tournament, national and international ranking. n addition, you will be credited with a free mission to offset the shortened mission experience.
