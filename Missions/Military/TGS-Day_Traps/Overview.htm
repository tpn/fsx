<p class="BRFbodycopy">Your objective in this mission is a simple one: launch off an aircraft carrier and try to trap (land) six times. As you fly each approach, the Landing Signal Officer (LSO) will provide you with verbal advisory and mandatory glide slope, line up and airspeed calls if you need it. During a perfect approach, you won’t hear the LSO speak at all. Perfect passes are rare&mdash;both in the sim and in a real Hornet.
<br>
<p class="BRFbodycopy">After each attempt (called a “pass” in Navy-speak), the LSO will evaluate your pass. Listen to his comments, and try to do better the next time.
<p class="BRFbodycopy">The mission ends once you've made six passes (landing attempts). Traps, bolters, and waveoffs all count as passes.
<br>
<p class="BRFbodycopy"><em>For detailed instructions on how to fly each pass, see the Details tab of this briefing.</em>

<p class="BRFbodycopy">With over 5,000 flight hours and more than 1,200 carrier landings in the F-14 Tomcat, Dale “Snort” Snodgrass is the most experienced Tomcat pilot in the world. Only a few select Naval Aviators qualify as a Senior Air Wing Landing Signal Officer (LSO), as such Snort spent many years working on board aircraft carriers quailing new pilots. Snort helped create this highly-realistic mission, which we hope you’ll find both fun and challenging. If the audio in the mission sounds realistic, it’s because Snort plays the LSO!
<p class="BRFbodycopy">Make no mistake: flying this mission isn’t easy. But neither is landing on a real aircraft carrier. While the consequences for making an error are admittedly not as high in the sim, we believe that anyone who takes the time to master this mission will acquire a good taste of what real naval aviators experience every time they make an arrested landing in a real Hornet.

<p class="BRFbodycopy"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>
<br>
Due to a limitation in the aircraft carrier simulation within Microsoft FSX Acceleration, the simulation may detect more than one wire being caught during a single trap. If this happens the mission will end prematurely. In order to compensate for this possibility, the TopgunSim scoring system will take the average of the actual passes taken in that mission and assign that averaged score to the remaining passes not taken. If this happens, your score will still count for purposes of tournament, national and international ranking. In addition, you will be credited with a free mission to offset the shortened mission experience.
